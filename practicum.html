                    <p>
                        I completed my practicum at STMicroelectronics Inc. Calamba, a global semiconductor manufacturer and part of a Switzerland-based multinational corporation. The Calamba site specializes in the assembly, testing, and packaging of integrated circuits used across automotive, industrial, and consumer electronics sectors. The company combines advanced technology with sustainable practices and smart manufacturing processes to deliver high-quality semiconductor solutions.

                    <p>
                        As a Process Engineer in the OPS 1 Assembly department, my primary responsibilities included developing data visualization tools for defect tracking and yield analysis. I created comprehensive Excel dashboards that provided real-time insights into production inefficiencies, later transitioning these to interactive Power BI reports to automate data visualization. Beyond analytics, I conducted 5S audits to evaluate workspace organization, performed manufacturing process validations, and participated in quality control inspections to identify and document package defects. This hands-on experience gave me valuable exposure to semiconductor manufacturing workflows from mold assembly to final inspection processes.

                    <p>
                        I completed 344 hours of intensive training and work, beginning with 59.5 hours of orientation covering company policies, safety protocols, and technical training in Power BI and quality control tools. The subsequent 172.5 hours involved hands-on production operations where I applied these skills in real manufacturing scenarios. The final 112 hours were dedicated to my data analytics project, where I developed and implemented reporting tools that are now being used by the production team for daily monitoring and decision-making.

                    <h3 style="color: #764ba2; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>
                        This practicum provided transformative professional development at the intersection of computer science and semiconductor manufacturing. By developing analytical tools that evolved from Excel to Power BI, I demonstrated how technical skills can drive process improvements in industrial settings. The experience deepened my understanding of quality systems, production workflows, and the importance of data-driven decision making. Working alongside engineers and production staff, I gained valuable insights into cross-functional collaboration in a high-tech manufacturing environment. This immersion has solidified my interest in roles that combine analytical problem-solving with tangible industrial applications.
